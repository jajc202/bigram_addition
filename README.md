# **bigram_addition**
This will be an experiment to see if I can get a simple bigram model to 'learn' addition without using any of Python's built-in rules.

### **Note**
The baseline bigram model is my own implementation of Andrej Karpathy's bigram model, which can be found here: https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture
